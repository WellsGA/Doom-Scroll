# DoomScroll
## An Among Us mod about misinformation.

- DoomScroll folder contains the plugin for the most recent version of Among Us - 02. 28. 2023
- version_10_25_2022 is a plugin for the previous release - 10. 25. 2022

__Both versions are currently under development__
Since the latest Among Us release caused a lot of trouble for the main features of our plugin, we are focusing on finishing the prototype that works with the previous version first. 

 
This is an alternative version that doesn't use Reactor.

##Project Description

The goal of this mod is to integrate Among Us with mechanics that build on its social deception concept to make it a potential tool for training players to better investigate and identify misinformation. 

Games have become a point of interest for combating misinformation, as they allow for a controlled environment where players can practice their discernment abilities under realistic conditions without the risk of being exposed to actual misinformation. This makes them a valuable tool for "prebunking", otherwise known as inoculation: whereas debunking refutes misinformation after it has already spread, inoculation prepares individuals to anticipate and avoid misinformation before it has imprinted on their memory. The early prototypes of this genre of game involve basic proof-of-concept designs – single player, usually fictional narratives with a handful of investigative mechanics that teach the player about commonly used misinformation techniques. And while they represent an important step in the process, these games unfortunately ignore some of the more complex factors of misinformation discernment that make it so difficult – the pressures of dealing with real human beings possessing their own secret motives as sources of information, with information being presented that is true in some regards and false in others, in situations with actual stakes. With this mod, we hope to address these issues and push into the next phase of misinformation game design.

To do so, we have added the following game mechanics:

-a camera option where players can create screenshots during the standard round

-a sign-in function, where players can complete tasks but attribute the completion to another player

-a folder system containing both screenshots and the static data, that can be called during the meeting phase to use as evidence

-an updated chatfeed that allows folder artifacts to be shared amongst players, as well as removes the chat limiter so that players can see everything posted from previous rounds during a match

-secondary win conditions (SWCs) that give players ulterior motives in their play (e.g. Blue is crewmate, but must also protect Red; Red is crewmate, but must also frame Yellow). Success or failure of SWCs will be shown to all players at the completion of the match.
